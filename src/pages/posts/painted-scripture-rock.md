# Painted Scripture Rock

We love to inspire and share with the many talents our sisters have! Our ward theme for the year was, "His Grace is Sufficient" based on a talk by Brad Wilcox. Stephanie is a talented painter, so she designed and painted a rock for every sister with those words of truth. As a presidency, we visited every sister on or before her birthday which is a great way to better insure that each sister is personally visited at least once a year. We presented this gift along with a summary page of the highlights of the talk which we tucked inside a birthday card. What a meaningful gift and opportunity to individually visit sisters!
