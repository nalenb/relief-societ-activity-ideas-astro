As a Relief Society presidency, we usually want to give out something meaningful to the sisters in December. Most of us appreciate help with our scripture study. I asked the Elders Quorum President if he wanted to go in on a scripture journal idea for all of the adults. Each auxiliary had a good amount of leftover funds from the Covid year, so we pooled our budget. We asked a couple to take on this project who came up with these beautiful journals. They ended up being about $4 each which was still cheaper than anything else similarly already done.

For next year, when we will have a much smaller budget we also purchased a binding machine and combs to follow this tradition of giving a scripture journal that we can make ourselves using much cheaper resources. We purchased one of these binding paper punch machines when we homeschooled and used it for so many projects and books.
