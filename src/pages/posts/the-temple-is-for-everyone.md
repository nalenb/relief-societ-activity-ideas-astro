# Focus on the Temple

Recently, the Elders Quorum organized with Relief Society to have a regularly scheduled temple trip on the 3rd Thursday of each month. This is a great opportunity for all members!! I usually send out an email with the notice and reminder and suggest that there is a way for all to participate.

The wording can go something like this ...

Hello Sisters!

"My dear brothers and sisters, may you focus on the temple in ways you never have before. I bless you to grow closer to God and Jesus Christ every day. I love you. May God be with you until we meet again, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen." October 2022 General Conference By President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
