# Mini Pies

love to bake pies. They are a specialty of mine ever since I perfected my pie making and even my own crust recipe since I never liked the typical, dry, bland recipe from all of the cookbooks I grew up with. I don't even remember where I got this cute dough press so long ago, so I will share a similar one on Amazon.

## Mini Pie Press

Whenever the special occasion arrises to make pies, I invariably have excess dough which I cannot stand to just throw away, so I use this mini pie press to make mini pies. Take your leftover crust, roll it out as you would for your pie plate, press lightly into the bowl of the press, add some leftover filling being careful not to over fill as the crust needs to come in contact on both sides to seal, add another layer of crust on top to sandwich, then press the two together, cutting off any access dough. Don't forget to prick the dough a few times to vent. I figured out that it cooks well at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes in a toaster over or in your standard oven. Great little pies to deliver to loved ones, friends and those you minister to!

I found several great options to purchase
